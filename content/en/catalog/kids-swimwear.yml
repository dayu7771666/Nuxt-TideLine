# FAQ section

  title: 'Frequently Asked Questions'
  questions:
    - id: 1
      question: "What is the best fabric for children's swimwear?"
      answer: "The best fabrics for children's swimwear are those that are soft, stretchy, and durable, such as nylon or polyester blends with spandex. Look for materials that offer UPF 50+ sun protection and are chlorine-resistant for longer-lasting wear."
    - id: 2
      question: 'How do I choose the right size for my child?'
      answer: "To find the right size, refer to the brand's sizing chart and measure your child's chest, waist, and hips. If your child is between sizes, opt for the larger size to ensure comfort and room for growth."
    - id: 3
      question: 'Are there specific swimwear designs for toddlers?'
      answer: 'Yes, for toddlers, consider swimwear with added features like built-in swim diapers, adjustable straps, or zippers for easy changing. Rash guard sets provide extra sun protection and are popular among parents.'
    - id: 4
      question: "How do I care for my child's swimwear?"
      answer: 'Rinse swimwear with fresh water immediately after use to remove chlorine or salt. Hand wash with mild detergent and let it air dry flat. Avoid wringing the fabric, machine washing, or using dryers to maintain its elasticity and color.'
    - id: 5
      question: "Do children's swimsuits need UV protection?"
      answer: "Absolutely. Children's skin is more sensitive to UV rays, so swimwear with UPF 50+ protection helps block up to 98% of harmful sun rays. Pair it with sunscreen for complete coverage."
    - id: 6
      question: 'Can swimwear for children be used in both pools and the ocean?'
      answer: 'Yes, but swimwear exposed to chlorine or saltwater regularly should be made from chlorine- and fade-resistant fabrics to ensure durability. Quick-drying materials are also beneficial for ocean use.'
    - id: 7
      question: "What's the difference between a swimsuit and a rash guard?"
      answer: 'A swimsuit is a traditional one- or two-piece designed for swimming, while a rash guard is a top made of stretchy, UV-protective fabric. Rash guards are often paired with swim shorts or bottoms and provide extra sun protection, especially for water sports or prolonged sun exposure.'
