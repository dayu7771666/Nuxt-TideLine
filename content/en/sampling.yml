    - question: 'What happens after the sampling project?'
      answer: "After the sampling, you'll have a clear understanding of our capabilities and working style. We'll provide a detailed proposal for full-scale collaboration if you choose to move forward, but there's absolutely no obligation."
    - question: 'What kind of projects are suitable for sampling?'
      answer: "Sampling works well for MVPs, proof-of-concepts, specific feature development, or any project that can be broken down into a 2-4 week deliverable. We'll help you identify the right scope during our initial consultation."
    - question: 'How much does a sampling project cost?'
      answer: 'Sampling projects typically range from $5,000 to $15,000 depending on complexity. This is significantly less than a full-scale project and gives you tangible results to evaluate before making a larger investment.'
    - question: 'Who will work on my sampling project?'
      answer: "You'll work with a dedicated team of 1-2 senior developers who specialize in your required technology stack. This ensures high-quality output and gives you direct insight into how our team operates."
