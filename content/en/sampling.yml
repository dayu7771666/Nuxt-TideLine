  description: 'Our streamlined 6-step process ensures you get maximum value from your swimwear sampling project with clear deliverables at each stage.'
  steps:
    - number: 1
      title: 'Design & Fit Strategy Review'
      description: 'We analyze your tech pack and designs to establish the foundational fit block, target market measurements, and discuss key swim-specific construction techniques (e.g., flatlock stitching, lining, elastic application).'
    - number: 2
      title: 'Fabric & Trim Curation'
      description: 'We present and source approved swim-specific fabrics (e.g., nylon-spandex blends, recycled materials) and critical trims (e.g., chlorine-resistant elastics, bust cups, hardware) based on your performance and aesthetic needs.'
    - number: 3
      title: 'Pattern Engineering & Mock-up'
      description: 'Our technicians draft the first precision swimwear pattern, accounting for fabric stretch and recovery. A preliminary muslin or digital mock-up is often created to validate the fit on a form before cutting the final fabric.'
    - number: 4
      title: 'First Article Assembly & Internal Fitting'
      description: 'The first physical sample is constructed. We conduct a rigorous internal fit session on a live model or mannequin, checking for garment tension, gapping, and mobility to identify any construction adjustments.'
    - number: 5
      title: 'Sample Finishing & Quality Gate'
      description: 'The sample undergoes final finishing (e.g., hook & eye application, label sewing) and a stringent quality inspection for stitching integrity, seam flatness, and trim placement against your specifications.'
    - number: 6
      title: 'Feedback Integration & Production Pathway'
      description: 'You receive the sample for evaluation. We consolidate your feedback on fit, fabric hand-feel, and overall aesthetic to refine the prototype and present a clear roadmap to production, including grading rules for your size set.'

  title: 'Frequently Asked Questions'
  items:
    - question: 'What is typically included in your sampling service, and what is the cost?'
      answer: "Our sampling service is a comprehensive package that includes pattern engineering, sourcing of approved fabrics and trims, construction of one physical prototype, and an internal fit analysis. The cost is project-specific and varies based on the design's complexity, chosen materials, and trim details. We provide a transparent quote after our initial consultation to align on the scope."
    - question: 'What is the typical turnaround time for a sample?'
      answer: 'The standard timeline for a first prototype is 2-3 weeks. This period includes material sourcing, pattern development, and meticulous construction. We can discuss expedited options for urgent projects, and timelines are always confirmed upfront.'
    - question: 'Do I need to provide a complete tech pack, or can you work from my design concept?'
      answer: 'We can work with both. A detailed tech pack allows for the most accurate and efficient process. However, if you have a design concept or inspiration, our team can help you develop it into a production-ready specification, including fit, fabric, and construction recommendations.'
    - question: 'How do you handle fit and sizing for samples?'
      answer: "We begin by aligning on a base fit block and specific grade rules for your target market. The first sample is constructed to these precise specifications and is evaluated internally on a standard dress form. We highly recommend you also conduct your own fit session on a live model that matches your target customer's measurements."
    - question: 'Can you source specific or sustainable fabrics for my sample?'
      answer: 'Absolutely. We have established relationships with mills offering a wide range of performance and sustainable fabrics (e.g., recycled nylon, OEKO-TEXÂ® certified materials). We will curate options based on your aesthetic, performance, and sustainability goals and provide swatches for your approval.'
    - question: 'What happens if the sample requires adjustments after delivery?'
      answer: "Iteration is a core part of the sampling process. We include one round of detailed feedback consolidation after you receive your first sample. We'll analyze your notes on fit and construction and present a clear plan for revisions, including any associated costs and timeline for a second prototype if needed."
    - question: 'How does the sampling process transition to bulk production?'
      answer: "The final, approved sample serves as the 'gold standard' for production. We use the refined patterns, confirmed materials, and construction details from the sampling phase to create a seamless production roadmap, providing you with a firm quotation for your bulk order based on your required quantities."
